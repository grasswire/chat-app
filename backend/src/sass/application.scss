 * If you want to use Bootstrap strip out all of these guys.  Normalize is
 * redundant (it's included in bootstrap) and Bootstrap comes with a grid.
 * Font awesome isn't needed either, so you can strip that out too, but I
 * personally like those fonts better and I know most developers end up putting
 * that in at some point anyway.  Include-media is a great tool for working
 * with media queries, I think you should look into it, but again, with Bootstrap
 * it may not be needed.

/**
 * Most of your code *should* nicely fit into modules, but I'd the truth is that
 * not everything is a module.  Sometimes, things are really related to a specific
 * page. So, when you have content that is only for a specific page, it should go
 * into this section.
 *
 * Now, if you have a small site one single _page.scss file should be enough.
 * However, if you've got a big site, don't try and cram everythning into one
 * file.  Break your _page.scss up into logical page modules:
 *
 * pages/_login
 * pages/_landing
 *
 * Now this might seem silly to say, but try very hard to *not* use pages.
 * You want your CSS to be like little legos that can move from page-to-page
 * and section-to-section.  When you find yourself dumping stuff in the
 * page section, ask yourself, "would this be better as a module?"

 *
 * Important thing to note about modules: they're discrete objects.  They should
 * not rely on any other module.  Someone should be able to come into this file
 * and move all the modules around and your site should work fine.  No cascade.
